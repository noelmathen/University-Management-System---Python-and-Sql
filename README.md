## University Database Management System

The University Database Management System is a Python-based application that helps manage various aspects of a university, including student information, faculty details, courses offered, and department records. This project utilizes MySQL database to store and organize the data. The system provides an interactive command-line interface to add, view, and modify records, making it user-friendly and efficient.

### Key Features:
- **Student's Corner**: Add and view student details, including personal information and marks.
- **Faculty's Corner**: Manage faculty data, view all students, and enter/update student marks.
- **About Courses**: Register new courses and view existing course details.
- **About Departments**: Add new departments and view department information.
- **Truncate Data**: Allows administrators to delete all data from the database (caution required).

This University Database Management System is designed to enhance data management within an academic institution. It can be further expanded and customized to meet specific university requirements.

*Note: This project is intended for educational purposes and serves as an example of a database management system for a fictional university.*
